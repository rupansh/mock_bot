# mock_bot
Converts text to mocked and puts it on top of a spongemock image. Sounds easy but I had to read paragraphs worth of imagemagick articles

# How to use
- Insert your bot token in the **TOKEN** variable
- Inside the magick string variable, change the magick to convert (don't change the variable name kthx)
- Only use the bob.img supplied or change the -size and the source image accordingly
- /help on telegram
